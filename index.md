# FocusNexus

### Track your focus. See your patterns. Improve with clarity.

FocusNexus is a lightweight focus tracking app designed to help you become more aware of how and when you focus best. No timers. No complicated productivity systems. Just simple session-based tracking and meaningful insights.

### How It Works

Log a focus session in seconds:
• Choose a session type (Meeting, Reading, Movie, or Custom)
• Rate how focused you were
• Optionally note what distracted you

That’s it.

Over time, FocusNexus turns your sessions into clear insights.

### See Your Focus Clearly

• Today’s Focus Score – Know how focused your day has been
• Focused Streaks – Track consecutive fully focused sessions
• Weekly & Monthly Scores – Understand long-term trends
• Focus by Session Type – See where you perform best
• Top Distractions – Identify recurring focus blockers

All data stays on your device. No account required.

### Designed for Awareness

FocusNexus is built for people who:
• Want to understand their focus habits
• Prefer reflection over timers
• Value privacy and simplicity
• Want insights without pressure

No push notifications.
No cloud sync.
No overwhelm.

Just clarity.
